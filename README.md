The hackathon asked asked for an additional feature for the current Myntra application. We decided to implement this feature based on our personal experiences with the current fashion system in India. We have stuck closely with Myntra's purpose and theme while approaching this project as seen in the user interface below. 

Take a look at our approach.

# Personalised Body Type Fashion Recommender and Classifier 

You may ask yourself why this trendy outfit that looks so good on this person not look as good on me?

The fashion industry's current recommendation systems currently focus only on purchase history, similar buying patterns and new trends. They lack personalization based on a user's body type. 

We attempt to solve this issue by recommending products for the user’s body type that are more likely to suit the user’s figure. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based recommendation system that personalizes clothing suggestions based on body shape, hence providing better results than existing methods.
